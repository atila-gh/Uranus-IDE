# Uranus IDE — Multilingual, RTL-Friendly Python Environment

**Uranus IDE** is a lightweight, extensible Python development environment inspired by Jupyter and built with PyQt5. It offers a modular, cell-based interface for writing, executing, and documenting Python code — with full support for multilingual workflows and right-to-left (RTL) languages.

## 🌍 Built for Global Developers

Uranus IDE is designed to empower developers, educators, and students across the world. 
It supports Unicode natively and handles RTL scripts with precision, making it ideal for communities working in:

- **Persian (Farsi)**  
- **Arabic**  
- **Hebrew**  
- **Urdu**  
- **Pashto**  
- **Syriac**  
- **Kurdish (Sorani dialect)**  
- **Divehi (Maldivian)**  
- **Yiddish**

> ⚠️ **Why Uranus?**  
> The creation of Uranus IDE was directly motivated by the lack of proper RTL support in mainstream tools like Jupyter.
 Despite its popularity, Jupyter has long overlooked the needs of developers working in right-to-left languages.
 Uranus aims to fill this gap by offering a truly RTL-aware Python IDE.  
>  
> We hope this project becomes a collaborative platform for developers from RTL language communities to contribute, extend, and
 benefit from a tool that finally speaks their language — both literally and structurally.
